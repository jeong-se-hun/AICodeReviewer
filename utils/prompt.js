  - Evaluate the code's readability, maintainability, and performance, and suggest improvements.
  - Identify potential bugs or errors and point out specific issues.
  - If the code does not follow best practices, suggest alternatives.
  - Understand the code's intent and recommend more efficient implementation methods.
  - Identify and suggest removal or simplification of redundant or unnecessary code.
